This software was originally built for my Year 11 VET Integrated Technologies class project. It was a project we had to complete in order to pass the class. The requirement was to make an electronic die that would display as a physical die would.

Here is a link to a video showcasing what it does: https://youtu.be/PV7qDXLKhSw
